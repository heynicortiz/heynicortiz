### 📝 A little about me...
As I graduated from high school, I saw two main paths ahead of me:
* Stay in my hometown of Milwaukee and pursue Computer Engineering
* Move to sunny Miami and study International Business

At the time, I chose to move out and go on an entirely new adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed my education, including a study abroad experience in China, and the decade of experience in public sector parks and recreation management that followed.

In late 2021, however, I decided to change gears. I began a computer science degree (completed in late 2022) and sought out further opportunities to supplement that formal education with more hands-on work. I completed CodePath's Android Development and Software Engineering courses which solidified the idea in my mind that I was making the right move to transition careers to software engineering.

Now, I am working on The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, and other resources to get more project based experience with JavaScript and fullstack development to prepare myself to take on a "real" project.

I am looking forward to what the future brings and am excited for the opportunities out there.

### 🛠️ Projects

#### [👨‍🌾 Finding Fresh](https://github.com/CodePath-AND102-Group-12/FindingFresh)
One of my favorite projects that I've worked on so far was during my CodePath Android Development course. Finding Fresh is a native Android application written in Kotlin and developed with a small group. This project was my first time working in a team for software development and we were selected as part of a small group to present at CodePath's National Demo Day for Fall 2022.
