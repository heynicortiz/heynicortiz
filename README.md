### üìù A little about me...
As I graduated from high school, I saw two main paths ahead of me:
* Stay in my hometown of Milwaukee and pursue Computer Engineering
* Move to sunny Miami and study International Business

At the time, I chose to move out and go on an entirely new adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed my education, including a study abroad experience in China and a follow-up MBA, as well as the decade of experience in public sector parks and recreation management that followed.

In 2021, however, I decided to change gears. I began a computer science degree (completed in late 2022) and sought out further opportunities to supplement that formal education with more hands-on work. I completed CodePath's Android Development and Software Engineering courses which solidified the idea in my mind that I was making the right move to transition careers to software engineering.

Now, I am working on The Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, and other resources to get more project based experience with JavaScript and fullstack development to prepare myself to take on a "real" project.

I am looking forward to what the future brings and am excited for the opportunities out there.
